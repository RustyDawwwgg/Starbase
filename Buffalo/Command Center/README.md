# Buffalo Command Center

In this tutorial, you will learn how to upgrade the Buffalo's YOLOL rack area into a full-blown diagnostics/command center - perfect for troubleshooting your devices and YOLOL code!

### Parts List
- 2x Panel Bases
- 6x Control Table Plates (24x72 cm)
- 8x Basic Plates (12X48 cm)
>Note: you can retrieve them from this location next to the pilot's seat and use rebuild tool to create more. Or you can just craft some if you don't care about the materials/looks as it will be hidden behind your devices anyways

- Your choice of text panels/buttons that will fit in the space
>Note: I used 24X24 cm text panels as a demonstration in this tutorial. Up to 28 of these will fit in the available space

- Your choice of YOLOL chip readers to replace empty racks

### Instructions
- Remove the 4 lower wall panels closest to the MFC
> Note: Leave the corner pieces in place and make sure they are still bolted to something after removing the wall panels so they don't float away while you're working.

- Stack 3 Control Table Plates (24x72 cm) together at the lowest point you can wth them all the way inside the wall on each side of the MFC
>Note: you will need to add bolts after placing each panel inside the wall to ensure everything passes durability standards. Here's an image with the left side partially assembled for reference

> Note: left side can go down more as there's no duct corner piece in the way. I just assembled the right side first and aligned the left side with that afterwards to keep things simple

- Place/bolt panel bases on the lowest squares of the control table plate stacks and wire them to the floor ducts

> Note: pay close attention to the grey tab on the panel bases and make sure it points upwards so your devices can connect to them! The first device must slightly overlap into this tab as shown in this image

- Fill in the empty spaces with the 12X48 cm plates & bolt them into place.

- Attach devices directly onto the wall starting from the banel base and working upwards

> Note: Devices must connect inline with the base in order to receive data. There cannot be any gaps in your setup or devices across the gap will lose connection

- Replace as many empty YOLOL racks as you like with chip readers. I added 3 extra chip readers to my setup for a total of 4 chip readers as shown in the completed installation image below
