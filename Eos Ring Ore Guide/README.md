# Eos Ring Ore Guide (version 2.0)

A lot of players were confused (myself included) by the graphical images that were available representing where to find ore in the ring around Eos. After gathering all the information I could from the Starbase Discord and 4other sources, and grasping an in-depth (pun intended) understanding of this information, I decided to design a new graphic to help out new players, or those who may still be confused.

If you have any suggestions and/or corrections that you would like to submit, feel free to [engage in the discussion](https://github.com/RustyDawwwgg/Starbase/discussions/1)!

### UPDATE (version 2.0)
After receiving a lot of feedback from the previous version and deciding to take a trip out to zone 5 myself to precisely measure distances and confirm a lot of things you guys were telling me, I learned a lot about how the ring is structured and decided to update my recently released graphic - now with a new title as it's much more complete and deserving of being called a "guide". Here's a list of changes that were made:

- Designation of asteroid "classes" (A-E) for added clarity

- Inclusion of Zone 1 + tapering off before top/bottom *Note: I've yet to personally verify the tapering but several sources confirm this to be so

- Redesigned ore zones graphic to better represent actual zone sizes

- Added total ring width/height estimations

- Added "Transition Zones" graphic with description

- Updated zone 3 distances to "250K~570M" while near 0 on x/y axis- CONFIRMED!

- Updated zone 4 begin distance to "570KM" while near 0 on x/y axis with 60KM wide transition zone for Class C+D (all in ice)- CONFIRMED!

- Updated zone 5 end distance to 1050KM *Note: this is a "best guess" estimate as I was using nearby station transponders to determine direction/distance due to ISAN's limited range

- Updated rarity on Exorium (class B), and Corazium (class E). *Note: rarity is based on my own experience and ymmv

- Added version/date info to help keep track of changes

Hope you all enjoy the new version and please be sure to let me know if there's anything else in need of changing.
