# Automatic Rapid Deceleration

### Functionality
- First line ensures the code will only progress while actively moving the ship forward
- Second line waits for you to stop forward thrust then applies full backward thrust the moment you do
- Each blank line you add before the final line will delay the script for 0.2 seconds
- Finally, it will turn off reverse thrust and restart the script

> Note: This script is a good stepping stone towards more complicated scripts that control thrust variables such as auto-approach and avoidance systems to name a few examples. Can also be used in lieu of or separated from such systems if you just want a simple braking system for manual flight
