# Stacks Scanner

### Functionality
- Interacts with button + text panel to display information related to scanner activity/results
- Displays "OFF" status initially and when scan cycle resets without material discovery
- Converts scanned material results into "stacks" and rounds to one decimal place then prints the converted results to a text panel
- Holds information on-screen regarding last scan until the next scan cycle is initiated
