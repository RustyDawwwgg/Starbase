# Eos Ore Zones

A lot of players were confused (myself included) by the graphical images that were available representing where to find ore in the ring around Eos. After gathering all the information I could from the Starbase Discord and 4other sources, and grasping an in-depth (pun intended) understanding of this information, I decided to design a new graphic to help out new players, or those who may still be confused.
