# My Razer NAGA Profile
Starbase-related keybinds I have saved to my mouse. I use mouse in right hand and PS4 controller in my left with controller keybinds handled by [DS4Windows](https://github.com/Ryochan7/DS4Windows). I like right-click to be jump/jetpack-up and have the controller emulate right-click on the L1 button.
